you can either pass arguments directly::

  ~/bin/python-scripts/run.py 'git checkout master' ./first-repo/ /tmp/second-repo/ ~/third-repo/

or define some replacements into runcommand.py,
which will be evaluated. it is found in actual direcotry only.

  # beginnig of runcommand.py
  import os.path

  MY_DIRS = (
      './first-repo',
      '/tmp/second-repo',
      os.path('~/third-repo/'),
  )

  my_command = 'git checkout master'

  # end of runcommand.py

and than call::

  ~/bin/python-scripts/run.py my_command MY_DIRS

you can define as many variables as you want,
and there are two special names _cmd and _ALL,
which are found if no params are given

  # beginnig of runcommand.py
  import os.path

  MY_DIRS = (
      './first-repo',
      '/tmp/second-repo',
      os.path('~/third-repo/'),
  )

  my_command = 'git checkout master'

  _ALL = MY_DIRS
  _cmd = my_command

  # end of runcommand.py

if you now call::

  ~/bin/python-scripts/run.py

now all three script calls are equivalent
